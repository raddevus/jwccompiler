## From Jack W. Crenshaw's Online Document
You can read more about the original at: [https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/)

## Background
I stumbled upon this reference from a X.com post and found it interesting and instantly wanted to translate Crenshaw's code from his original Turbo Pascal to C#.

## Branches = Steps
I will create branches named StepN (where N is a incremented value).
### Step1
Step1 is complete and contains the (converted) code as shown in the first write-up at: [https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/tutor1.txt](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/tutor1.txt)
